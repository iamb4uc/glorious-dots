# ST
---
This is a compilation of all the st builds I have make, tho these basically have similar patches to them but the theme is different I will provide a screenshot of each of this builds on their own README.md file on their directory.  

### Installation

***For Void linux***
Edit the config.mk file with the following

```make
PREFIX = /usr/local
MANPREFIX = $(PREFIX)/share/man

X11INC = /usr/include/X11
X11LIB = /usr/lib/X11
```

**You can see the change in X11INC and X11LIB, Everything else is the same for compilation.**
